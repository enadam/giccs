pytype, pyright (MS), pyre (FB)
build python3-cryptography with BoringSSL for faster AES-GCM-SIV

args -> self
DirEnt.volatile -> obj?
configparser -> tomllib?

upload/download: split plan and execution
consider using clone sources when uploading
consistency check of remote backups
CmdFTPGet, CmdFTPPut: DryRunOptions, WetRunOptions, AutodeleteOptions?

discover_local_snapshots(): from btrfs subvolume show -> Snapshot(s)
	but it doesn't know about restored snapshots
deprecate index list/delete (in favor of ftp commands)
	we could also simplify delete remote

caching:
	single file in the root dir
	two caches:
		directory structure:
			make DirEnt.obj dynamic
			built into GCSGlobber
		Backup:s:
			snapshot name and uuid
			make BackupBlob:s dynamic

document max blob size (5 TiB)
document required permissions
  * storage.objects.create
  * storage.objects.update (for patch(), to update metadata)
  * storage.buckets.get (for --bucket)
  * storage.buckets.list (for list buckets)
  * storage.objects.list
  * storage.objects.get
document the use of gpg-agent
document dependency on python3-glob2

protect against:
  * swapping entire blobs: authenticated data includes the blob UUID
  * swapping chunks between blobs: same + end-to-end hash
  * reordering chunks: PRNG nonces + end-to-end hash
  * blob truncation: expected number of bytes + end-to-end hash
  * traffic analysis: padding, latency-shaping
external encryption must generate and verify the MAC
